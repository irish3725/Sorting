This project generates a list of integers. This size and range of values
in the list is decided by the user. The point of this project was for
me to get a basic understanding of how to use python. 

Currently the only two algorithms that are implimented are bubble sort
and insertion sort. Bubble sort is the first one that I implimented and
although it works, it takes a really long time to run. I think I may have
an error in my code. Insertion sort works fine.
